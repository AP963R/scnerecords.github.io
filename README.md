SCNEÂ® are a Music Production Duo who have worked with some major UK music artists of late. They are fairly new to the scene and wanted me to build them a site that would embody their high-quality work and complement their continued rise to the top.

I really enjoyed making this minimal yet classy website. The videos, music and artwork arrangement was key to showcasing their rising reputation. Challenges encountered with the cart checkout. I have begun working on this but have yet to setup the method of payment and ability for customers to remove or add items to their basket. The local storage setup is there for calculating the cost of goods altogether as well as allowing the customer to not lose their basket when refreshing the page.
